Problem description: 
     We have a list of users. Each user has access permission to some resources. 
     We need to know all authorized users on a given set of resources.

     Please write a class/method that returns a list of users names (String[]).
     Arguments passed in to the method include: 
         1. All users (String[]) 
         2. Resources that these users can access (String[])
         3. A given set of resources we want to users to access (String[])

Example: 1. We have 3 users "john", "mike", "carson".
         2. John can access the following resources, "dev", "train"
         3. Mike can access the following resources, "dev", "qa"
         4. Carson can access the following resources, "qa", "prod"
         
         We want to know which users can access both "qa" and "prod".
 
         We will pass three arguments to your method.

         String[] users = {"john", "mike", "carson"}
         String[] permissions = {"dev train", "dev qa", "qa prod"} (note that they are space delimited)
         String[] resources = {"qa", "prod"}

         In this case, your program should return String[] with {"carson"}.

Requirements: 
          1. Method signature:
             String[] findAuthorizedUsers(String[] userlist, String[] permissions, String[] resources)
          2. Make your program work for general scenarios assuming all arguments are valid.
          3. Return an empty array of string if no user is qualified.
          4. Write two JUnit test cases for the method findAuthorizedUsers
